What is OpenRTM plug-in?
================

| The OpenRTM plug-in is a plug-in for linking with OpenRTM-aist (hereinafter referred to as "OpenRTM") that is middleware for robots (RT middleware) developed by National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology.
| 
| OpenRTM is a type of middleware for robots(RT middleware).
| "RT Middleware (RT-middleware: RTM)" is a generic name that refers to a software platform for building a robot system (RT system) by combining multiple software modules of robot functional elements (RT functional elements).
| The RT function element constituting the RT system is a robot component that provides a certain function, for example, a device unit such as a servomotor, a sensor, a camera, or a movable carriage and an arm realized by combining these components. Also, not only those related to hardware but also elements composed only of software such as control algorithms and image processing algorithms can be thought of as RT function elements.RT Middleware is the platform for easily constructing a robot system by hierarchically combining these modularized RT function elements.
|
| By using the OpenRTM plug-in, you can use the RT component (software module for robot element) developed for OpenRTM-aist from Choreonoid.
